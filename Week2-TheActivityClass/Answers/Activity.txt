1. Warmup Exercise:

a) Open the ActivityLifecycleWalkthrough.pdf chart in the Misc directory. This chart depicts two state machines, representing the lifecycles of ActivityOne and ActivityTwo. If you want you can cut out the little circles and use them as markers as you work through this exercise.

b) Suppose the user starts the application, which brings up ActivityOne. Next, suppose the user presses the Button to start ActivityTwo, and that ActivityTwo then appears on the screen.

> Open Application
ActivityOne? Entered the onCreate() method
ActivityOne? Entered the onStart() method
ActivityOne? Entered the onResume() method
> Clicked "Start Activity Two" button
ActivityOne? Entered the onPause() method
ActivityTwo? Entered the onCreate() method
ActivityTwo? Entered the onStart() method
ActivityTwo? Entered the onResume() method
ActivityOne? Entered the onStop() method

c) Next, suppose the user navigates back to ActivityOne by pressing the “Close Activity” Button of ActivityTwo. ActivityTwo closes and then ActivityOne reappears. Starting where you left off after the previous step:


> Clicked "Close Activity" button
ActivityTwo? Entered the onPause() method
ActivityOne? Entered the onRestart() method
ActivityOne? Entered the onStart() method
ActivityOne? Entered the onResume() method
ActivityTwo? Entered the onStop() method
ActivityTwo? Entered the onDestroy() method

d) Next, the user presses the Button to start ActivityTwo again. Once ActivityTwo appears, the user presses the Home Key on the device. Starting where you left off after the previous step:

> Clicked "Start Activity Two" button
ActivityOne? Entered the onPause() method
ActivityTwo? Entered the onCreate() method
ActivityTwo? Entered the onStart() method
ActivityTwo? Entered the onResume() method
ActivityOne? Entered the onStop() method
> Clicked HOME button
ActivityTwo? Entered the onPause() method
ActivityTwo? Entered the onStop() method

e) Next, the user starts the application again, by clicking on its icon in the Launcher. Once the application has restarted, and starting where you left off after the previous step:

> Restart Application
ActivityTwo? Entered the onRestart() method
ActivityTwo? Entered the onStart() method
ActivityTwo? Entered the onResume() method
